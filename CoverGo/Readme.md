What could have been improved?
# I could have used more boundry conditions to validate products like product with empty name and o price should not land up in shopping cart.
# I could have applied little bit inventory management to check the inventory count before adding product to the cart.
# I could have applied parametrized testing to validate multiple inputs for same test cases
